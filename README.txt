### Caveats

Wireframe Theme may or may not be a good fit for your next project. Please take a look at the Requirements, Wiki, Issues and source code to get a feel if Wireframe Theme is what you're looking for.

Various components & modules may use different licenses due to certain library dependencies. For example: [Wireframe Child](https://github.com/mixatheme/wireframe-child/) theme must be GPL-3.0+ because it uses Bootstrap, but [Wireframe Theme](https://github.com/mixatheme/wireframe-theme/) is still licensed under GPL-2.0 or greater.
